# Employment Data Explorer
Welcome to the [BFI Research and Statistics Unit's](https://www.bfi.org.uk/industry-data-insights/) [Employment Data Explorer](https://bfi-rsu.github.io/employment/) (alpha release). Here you will find two reports containing analyses and visualisations of film industry workforce information, drawn from data collected and published by the Office for National Statistics.

Data comes from two sources:

* [The Annual Population Survey (APS)](https://bfi-rsu.github.io/employment/aps-report.html)
* [The Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR)](https://bfi-rsu.github.io/employment/idbr-report.html)

Both sources rely on SIC codes -- the [UK Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007) -- to extract information about the film industry workforce. See the [About](https://bfi-rsu.github.io/employment/about.html) page for an overview of the relevant SIC codes, and details of what they include and exclude.
